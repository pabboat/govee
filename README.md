Just a starting library using example scripts from Govee and basic python.

Obtain your API Key from Govee. I did this using the Govee Home app on IOS. Go to youre profile, select settings, and then Apply for API Key. 
I got the email with the key pretty quickly. You can use the provided json template or enter it manually in the provided functions.
